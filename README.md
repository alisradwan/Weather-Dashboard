## What I learned

I learned many important fundementals of javascript creating this project. I learnd prety new thing in js which is how to featch an api in js and get whaterver data that I need to show up in my page. I used a combination of objects, arrays, function calls, while statements and if statements. I learned how to call functions, return values and many different manipulations that can be performed on objects, arrays and numbers like Math.Floor, Math.random and isFinite. I also learned commonly used operators like ! and ===. I really enjoyed my time learning and creating this project!
